## Project Goals
With this project, I was able to take my deepest dive yet into the Python programming language. The project's tasks focus on banking and election data, and they are designed to give students a solid foundation in a code that will serve as the basis for many projects (and perhaps job opportunities) to come. 

## Tools and Solutions
This project presented me with a momentous challenge: writing my first Python programs</a>! I used those programs to access large CSV files of both banking and election data. In the **PyBank** portion of the project, I created <a href="https://github.com/sonder74/python-challenge/blob/master/**PyBank**/main.py">loops and variables</a> that iterated through the data, manipulated it with simple mathematical formulas, and then generated a printed report. In **PyPoll**, I had the chance to practice <a href="https://github.com/sonder74/python-challenge/blob/master/**PyPoll**/main.py">more complicated loop structures</a>, which I used to gather electoral data from different candidates before generating a printed report.

## Outcomes and Lessons Learned
Upon finishing **PyBank** and **PyPoll**, I felt much more confident about my foundational Python skills, and ready to code my way through more challenging logic problems. You can view my final code <a href="https://github.com/sonder74/python-challenge/blob/master/**PyBank**/main.py">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sonder74/python-challenge/blob/master/**PyPoll**/main.py">here</a>.
